# Project Details
This project was assigned in my CS 310 Software Engineering class. It is an exercise for making a playable version 
of tic-tac-toe through java in the Command window. The user plays with another player,and each player takes turns choosing a space to occupy a 3x3 grid. 
The first player to get 3 spaces aligned in a row wins 
the game and receives a congratulatory message. This project gave great practice for using arrays and loops to get various 
results. It was important to keep a check of how many spaces had been occupied so that if the game tied, it wouldn't break.
The game could also have a GUI created for it to involve practice with implementing interfaces.
