# Project Details
This project was assigned in my CS 310 Software Engineering class. It is an exercise for making a playable version 
of tic-tac-toe through java in the Command window.  The user plays with another player,and each player takes turns choosing a space to occupy a 3x3 grid. A series of boolean values was used to control the games process. We used the ModelViewController method and used various loops to count the grid when a players choice was made. The model held the shape of the gameboard, the view kept the gameboard present and the controller allowed the players to play an actual game of tictactoe in the Command prompt of any terminal able to run the code.
The first player to get 3 spaces aligned in a row wins 
the game and receives a congratulatory message. This project gave great practice for using arrays and loops to get various 
results. The gameboard is displaed at the beginning of the game and comes to form as the conclusion gets closer. It was important to keep a check of how many spaces had been occupied so that if the game tied, it wouldn't break.
The game could also have a GUI created to implement an interface
